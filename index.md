### How do the Breaks work?
The ESSB Data Coffee Breaks are monthly online presentations around research data management. The meetings are _**short, focused, and informal**_. 
Every meeting one topic will be discussed. The same presentation will be held twice a month, so that many ESSB researchers can join one of the monthly sessions.  
We start the meetings with a 10-15 minutes presentation, followed by 15 minutes of questions and discussion.  
Nothing more than a 30 minute coffee break! But please bring your own coffee, tea and cookies.  

### What topics will be covered?
Most topics will be presented by the ESSB Research Data Steward, but if needed guests will be invited for more specialized topics. See below for a list of topics to be covered. Please contact Eduard for suggestions for other topics or speakers!  
These short presentations are of course nothing more than starting points, in-depth support and training will be organised when needed.
